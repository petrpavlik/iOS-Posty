/** The INMessage class provides access to message attributes and convenience 
methods for accessing attachments, marking as read, etc.

You should not create INMessage objects directly. You can fetch messages by
asking an INNamespace for a newMessageProvider and configuring that provider to 
return the result set you want (for example, all unread messages.)

To compose or send a new message, create an instance of INDraft and call it's 
-save and -send methods, respectively.

The Inbox platform is similar to Gmail in that many actions are taken on threads,
not on messages. If you're looking to archive, label, or delete a message, see
the documentation for INThread.
